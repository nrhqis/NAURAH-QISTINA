                I don't really have an image of me here in SMK Sungai Pusu. So, here is the view of the school. I studied here for less than 2 months from January to February. Since I was little, my mom always told me about the 'fun' of living in a boarding school. So, as a kid who knows next to nothing
                about the world, I was excited to get into a boarding school. But unfortunately, I only got the offer to study at a regular highschool, which is SMK Sungai Pusu. But I don't give up there because SMK SUngai Pusu also have hostels for the KAA students and after persuading my mother,
                we applied for it but I would have to change my class to a KAA class and I could never ask my mom to transfer me back to a normal school. And I accepted the offer.
            <p>
                Little did I know it will be the most hellish 2 months of my life. I'm a natural born scaredy-cat, after getting into the hostels, I got to know that the hostels is a place is where you should be careful moreover at night. As a scaredy-cat, I just know I would be living in fear.
                But I suck it up because I really want to stay in the hostel. But over time, there were more and more rules that we have to follow to avoid mystical things to happen in the hostel. Such as, you can't go to the drying rack at the back of the hostel at all before 6:00am or after 10:00pm, you <b>always</b> have to
                read "ayat pedinding" every night on every corner of your room and also every corner of your bed, and <b>never</b> go anywhere alone especially girls. I was living in fear for 2 months, I've tried to act brave but everyday there is always those talks about mystical things and my friend there
                loves to tell it to me because she knows I'm scared of it. And the one thing that really ticks me off is a few weeks before I got an offer to go to SMA MAIWP. There's a hysterical cases going on inside the hostel and it only got worse since then.
            <p>
                Also, not forgetting about how a warden called me a liar when I sprained my ankle. I was going down the stairs and the students were pushing each other like crazy, I was pushed and sprained my ankle. At first, it didn't hurt but over time I can feel my ankle pulsating and getting swollen.
                When you're sick in hostel, you always have to tell the warden there so that you can get it treated. But when I met the warden, the warden straight up told me that I'm lying about spraining my ankle because "I walk and look just fine from his point of view". I called my parents about the issue because
                I was really hurting but even my parents can't do anything because the warden was being stubborn. I walked with sprained ankle for about a week before I was allowed to go home. At that point, I can't feel anything but pain from my ankle and it took a long time for my ankle to heal.
            <p>
                Luckily, in February, I got a call from SMA MAIWP telling me that I'm qualified to attend the school. And without thinking any longer, I accepted the offer in a second because I've had enough of this school and want out.

                Sekolah Menengah Agama Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan or in short SMA MAIWP. SMA MAIWP is also a boarding school, ironic isn't it? But I doesn't regret accepting the offer to attend this school. It was one of the best and worst thing that happened in my life. SMA MAIWP located in Cheras.
                Just about 30 minutes from my home in KL. Anyway, I can say that this school because we have our own lift and there was never short of school appliances.

            <p>
                There, I met a lot of new friends that are very dear to me. The picture shows 3 Salam, my class. Some of them are still my bestfriends and we still kept in contact after all the years. The first day there, I was greeted at class by an outgoing girl who happens to be my dormmates. She is still my bestfriend until now. And it turns out
                more than half of my dormmates is my classmates too. From form 1 until form 3, it is accustomed for you to stay in the same class and the class is separated between boys and girls. So, for 3 years, all the salam girlies have a very strong bonds even though sometimes there is fights.
                I couldn't ask for a more better friends circles than I already have there.
            <p>
                The life there was peaceful and calm, no more being scared of going out to the toilets late at night, no more rules to keep 'things' away. One thing that hard for me is the subjects. We are a religious school, of course we would learn something along the line. And the three core islamic
                subject that we have to take is lughah arabiah muasirah (LAM), usuluddin and syariah. For the love of god, these three is my weakest subject. I can even score addmath higher than these three subjects. It is a miracle that I managed to keep my result good enough for me to stay.These three
                subjects require for you to memorise a lot and memorising is not my strong suit. And when I was form 4, I got to be in a science stream major class. Anyway, except from that, my overall experience there was all good.
            <p>
                But everything went south when Covid happens. I was already struggling as it is keeping me score good for the subjects but PKP made it worst. My mom said that I changed and asks me if I want to transfer school because she knew I struggled. It took a long time for me to think things thriugh because
                the thought of not be able to graduate at the same school with my friends was burdening me. I was reluctant just because of my friends. But at the end, I decided to transfer school for my own SPM result.

                SMK Seksyen 5 Wangsa Maju or for short, SVIAN is the third and last highschool that I got transferred to. Plus, SVIAN is not a boarding school by any means. My mom was the one who handled all the school transferring process so I don't even know to whhich school I will get transfered to. I attend this school just for a short while, for about 8 months
                I believe. I can't even remember. The first day I got into the school, it was all fine. Nothing too great happenned, just a normal day. Moreover, we were getting into serious mode because SPM is nearing so everyone just focused on studying. As an inrovert who already tired of starting a new friendship, I don't even bother to make real friends there.
                In fact, I was glad (maybe I did change just like my mom said). Anyway, before I transferred, of course I would tell my friends in SMA MAIWP about it. And the reactions... were not great. We cried for hours and they were mad at me because I decided to transfer at the last years of highschool.
                But over time, they accepted the fact and understand my reasoning to transfer because they were the ones who really saw how I was struggling and crumbling to keep myself up.

                For my experience in SVIAN is just normal. I don't really make friends and I don't really want to interact with anybody there. So, I just goes through my days normally and just focus on studying for the upcoming exam. Oh and we did actually celebrate my birthday at SVIAN as shown in the picture. My mom decided to make a suprise for me. Well, it was a good 
                suprise but I'm kind of embarassed because I don't interact with my other classmates so them seeing this is embarassing to me haha. And for SPM, I got 5A's and that's really all that I can remember from my result.
