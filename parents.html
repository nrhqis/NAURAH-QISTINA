                Once upon a time in college, a man meet a woman on a random day and he falls in love at first sight. Then, they get to know each other. After some time, they decided to build a family of their own.<br />
                The end.
            <p>
                That pretty much sums up my parents' love story. Honestly there's nothing much to tell as their story is just like any other love story existed.
            <p>
                Anyway, they got married on 15th of December 2002. As my mom is origninally from Johor and my father is originally from Kedah, they held the marriage ceremony on both state even though it is just a small ceremony. <br />
                Well, that was what my mom told me. But based on her marriage albums, I don't think it is a small ceremony =_= The picture above is a picture of them on their "nikah" ceremony.

                Let's get to know more about my father or as I call him Papa.His name is Mohd Radzi Bin Mohd Noh and this year he will turn 51 years old on August. My father works as a primary school teacher.<br />
                He have been teaching for as long as I can remember. And this is a picture of him on a school event at his previous school before he got transferred to another school in Kedah because I can't find a latest picture of him working.
            <p>
                My father mostly teaches science and music. He has always been the one who influenced me to love science, he used to teach me at home even though I don't go to the same school as his.<br />
                He did try to teach me music too but unfortunately, this daughter of his is tone deaf.

                Next is my mother or Mama. Her name is Norzaidah Binti Osman.She is 44 years old this year. Yes, my mother and father have 7 years age gap. My mother also work as a primary school teacher.<br />
                 I don't really remember when she started teaching but before she work as a teacher, she was a corporate worker. This is a picture of her at the school she got transferred to last year.
            <p>
                Unlike my father, my mother teaches Bahasa Melayu and mathematics. She was the one who teach me to read. By the age of 5, I could read a full sentence fluently without any help.<br />
                And by the age of 6, I could already read a whole Ana Muslim novel in an ease. My mother always told me that she already know that I can learn to read quickly because I have always been fond of books since I was a baby. But mathematics were not my strongest subject :P
