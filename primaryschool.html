                Once I was registered as a Year 1 student in 2011, my mother pushed me to become more and more active in the activities that the school held or joined. Being the introvert me, it is was a torture for me to go out and 'show' myself. But in the end, I'll still do it whether I like it or not
                But so far, the ones activity that I truly enjoyed was joining any activities related to Puteri Perlembagaan Islam Malaysia. Even though in the picture, I look like a twig about to crack into two anytime soon, I was actually quite hardy. I've joined camping contest, cooking contest,
                PPIM log books contest and many more that I've lost count. Every PPIM contest held, I would be in it, contesting. Although, at that time I felt so tired and quite burnt out, but I still gone through with it.

                Over the years, I've received quite the amounts of awards from all the contests that I've participated in. We have a full display of my throphies alone. I might saya that primary school was me at my peak. Thanks to my mother for pushing me, of course. But one of my favourite contest
                of all time was marching contest. One of my unforgettable memory about marching contest was when I was in Year 5, we were contesting to go to the final of the contest. The day was sunny but right when it is my school turn to march, it rained heavily so suddenly. But we still pull through despite the weather.
                We kept on marching and we got first place for that contest.

                All the sweat and tears that I've sacrificed were paid off when I got acknowledge as a figure in extracurricular.

                Academically, I won't say that I'm atually smart because I can't surpass my Indian classmates every exams. But I'm not that stupid either because I rarely got C's or D's on my exam result. I did got sent to attend tuitions for science, mathematics, Bahasa Melayu and English.
                The core subjects mostly. So, I'm quite satisfied with where I was in primary school.

                Making friends were hard for me but Hanis, the one who is sitting on the chair was my bestfriend throughout primary school. But we have grown apart from each other when primary school ended. Primary school was okay for me. Nothing too crazy to recall to.
                It was always the same routine everyday. I also attend primary islamic school but honestly, I hate it. I always finding excuses to avoid going to the islamic school. Eventhough, I hate going to the school, I always thrive every exams. I got 8A's in UPKK and 7A's 1B for UPSRA.
                Funnily, I don't even attend both 'Hari Anugerah Kecemerlangan' that was held for those exams. So, I always got the news about my result from the teachers that handle my class. I also didn't attend the ceremony held for taking UPSR result because I was so scared of my result.
                It was nothing crazy, I got 4A's 2B's and 1C.
