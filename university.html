                The same thing happened after I finished matriculation. My mother is the one who apply everything in UPU for me. But she also do not lost hope of getting me into IPG so she also apply IPG for me. This time, I got called to go for an interview at UPSI for the course TESL
                But unfortunately, I did not pass the interview. Later, I got an offer to continue my degree at UITM Kedah under the course of Information Science Library Management. I was a bit reluctant to accept the offer but I heard one of my far relative auntie graduated under the same major
                and she said it was worth to take. So, in the end I still accept the offer.

                        My first semester here, I met with many great peoples who are now my friends. And I'm so glad that I met them. In the first semester, I learnt so many new things that are so different from what I've ben majoring throughout highschool and matriculation.
                        But fortunately, it was quite fun even with the hurdles of completing an assignment. I also met with more new people who are from a very different background from me.

                           For the second semester, not gonna lie, it have been rough. The subjects were more dificult and there is so much to do in so little time. But we'll manage. Anyhow, I hope this semester treats me well.
