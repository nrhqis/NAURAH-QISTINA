                    <div>In this website I will tell you guys about my boring, anti-climaxing life story. Starting from when I was a kid until what I've become into now. I'm just like any ordinary kids trying to find the meaning of their existance and trying to live their life to the fullest. So, without further ado, in this website you guys will get to know me further by reading about my biodata, my family, educations, my endless interests and you guys will also get to see pictures of myself throughout the years.</div>
                <p>
                    <div>Hope you guys will enjoy my writings and get to know me better. As people say, you can't love what you don't know. So, I hope you guys can 'love' me after knowing my backgrounds.</div>
