                So, at the age of 4, my parents decided to sent me to school or to be more specific PASTI Al-Badar in Selangor.
                On the first day, only my father could go to sent me to school. We rode on his motorcycle so early in the morning. I'm not a morning type of a person so waking up that early in the morning is already a hard task for me.
                We arrived pretty late at school, all the other students have already started studying. My father said I was so reluctant to leave him and I just keep on hanging his shirt while crying. Until an ustaz came and grab me from my father and my father grab the chance to 'escape'.
                That was like the biggest betrayal ever for a 4 years old me at that moment. My father drove off so fast and I just keep on crying in front of the school. The ustaz tried to persuade me to come inside because it was almost midday but no success.
                The ustaz finally gave up and gave me a plastic chair from the class saying that I should sit while I'm waiting for my father. And I did. But not for too long as suddenly, the ustaz came and carried me inside while I'm sitting on the chair and place me at the edge of the class.
                I'm kind of grateful that the ustaz placed me there because honestly, I'm not ready to study at all that day. At that point, I've already stopped crying. I sat there quietly until it is time to go home. The other kids just look at me like I'm some kind of alien in that class.
                Like guys, come on. Haven't you guys see a kid cry? Anyway, when I'm old enough I got to learn that my father actually didn't go home that day. He just drove to a side of a house so that I can't see him and he watched me from afar. Until now, I got picked on by my family because of that incident.

                Fast forward a year later, I was pretty much a 'clever' student. Well, it is because my mother also taught me at home. I was also an active student. You might think I finished kindergarten accordingly. But on the last year of kindergarten, I quit half way through because
                I want to come with my mother to work at her school. My mother gave up and I attend primary school 'early'.

                This is me and my mother on teachers day 2010. Yes, I do have my own school uniform because I basically joined a class just like the other students did.
