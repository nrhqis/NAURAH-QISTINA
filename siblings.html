                As I've told in my biodata, I'm the oldest out of 5 siblings even though in these pictures I don't look like it. So, this is my 'lovely' siblings. As you guys can see, we mainly consist of girls.<br />
                The second child is the only son in this family. And all of the girls' name in my siblings all starts with Naurah, I don't really know what is the reason behind this but I guess it's kind of cute.

                The precious son was born just 2 years after me. His name is Muhammad Naufal Aqil Bin Mohd Radzi. This year he will turn 18. He just finished his SPM this year, and he passed with flying colors. <br />
                A round of applause please for my little brother &#x1F44F Also, fun fact about him is that he's not only the only son in my family but he is also the only grandson of our father's side family.<br />
                So, he is very loved, trust me.

                Tadaa, here is the twins, Naurah Nur Aneesa Binti Mohd Radzi (on the left) and Naurah Nur Aleesya Binti Mohd Radzi (on the right). They don't look alike because they are actually fraternal twins or also known as non-identical twins. They are born on 11th of May 2011. So they are 13 years old this year.
                I only got their baby images together because keeping them together in one frame is a hard task nowadays.
                They are currently studying at SMK Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar.

                And last but not least, the youngest, Naurah Surfina Binti Mohd Radzi. She is 9 years old. She goes to the same school where my mother works now.<br />
                She is very doted by our father, of course she would be, she's the youngest.
