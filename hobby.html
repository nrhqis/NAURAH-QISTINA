                In this page, I will write about some of my uncountable hobbies. Some of it I might forget to include in this, some I might write a little bit too much about but one thing that they all have in common is, they are all my favourite things to do >:)

            <p>
                So, cooking is one of my hobbies. I actually first learnt how to cook was when I was 9 years old. By the age of 10, my mom sent me to a cooking competition. Also, when I was 11 yeas old, my mom went into labour in the fasting month, and I'm the one who
                cooked for sahur for my brother and I also cooked lunch for the twins because they are still little at that time so they don't fast. Anyway, yeah since then I've cooked a lot of things. I can also bake. Donuts, cakes, cookies, say it all. If I put my mind into cooking
                something, I would do it. But honestly, I enjoy baking more than cooking. Baking requires a lot of patience and it is also calming. Unlike cooking where you would have to be alert all the time so that your food will not burn.

                I made macaroni and cheese earlier this year. My siblings literally inhaled this in 3 minutes.

            <p>
                As I've told you guys, I've always fond of books since I was little. So, of course it will be one of my favourite hobbies. I love reading novels so much, moreover if the novel genre is romance. Maybe I love it too much. Reading is my way to escape from reality.
                Imagining the scenes in the novels happens in my brain is just so much fun. Well, for me at least. But most of the time, I can only borrow the novels from my friends as I have a little to no money to buy them. I do have my own collection but it is just a small collection.
                One of my dreams is when I have my own money, I want to buy all the novels that I want without thinking if I have enough money or not.

            <p>
                Well I'm not sure if liking a K-POP group is a hobby but I'm gonna write about it here because I love K-POP. The one who first introduce me to K-POP is my auntie, I was 6 or 7 years old at that time. And the first K-POP group that she introduced was BIGBANG. They wer e
                a legend. But at that time, I don't really have an internet connection or even a gadget to get really into K-POP so I just mostly listen to their song. When I have my chance, I would discover more and new K-POP songs and groups even though I don't really stan them so much.
                But now I'm really into this one K-POP group named ATEEZ. My ultimate bias is Choi San. They recently have been going viral because of their new songs and album. I would love to collect their albums but I'm already barely eating right now, so I'm just gonna hold my urges.

            <p>
                Last but not least, I also enjoy playing video games. To be more precise, I love playing Valorant. I've always loved to play games but I was introduced to Valorant was at 2020. I was watching a streamer streaming Valorant. At first, I just love how he was so good in the game
                but over time I feel like I would really love to play the game. Since I don't have any computer at that moment, I use my father's. At first it was really awkward learning the controls so I learnt by observing the streamer who got me into Valorant. I also learn the
                stratergy and more things about Valorant from him. Now, I'm much better than how I first started but I don't have enough time to play the game.
