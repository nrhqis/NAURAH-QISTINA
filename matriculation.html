                After finishing highschool, I don't really have a goal where to continue my education. I don't know if it was my lack of will or just I don't care but everything was decided by mother. She really wants me to be a teacher so, she applied me for IPG and filled my UOU
                with UPSI and other university. She also applied me for medics. I don't really remember what she chose but I was already tired so I don't really care about it. Unfortunately, I don't get any offer to be a teacher but instead I got an offer to continue my education in matric. 
                Without dilly dallying, my mother told me to accept the offer and I did. I got an offer to go to College Matriculation Kedah and my parents seems so happy with the offer because I'm still in the same state as them.

                Anyway, I got a one year program for science stream major. And the life in matriculation is not that far off from highschool life the difference is only in matriculation, the class ended at 5:00pm. This time, I did make some friends there. But honestly, matriculation is hard.
                The syllabus and the programs are too packed so you are always on the run. In one day, you can finishes a topic in a subject. To make it worst is I'm taking science stream. A major where you have to be really quick to catch if you don't want to miss out the next chapter.
                But life there was great. I also got allowance every month for RM250 and the room in matriculation is so spacious I can bring my whole family in. So, it is quite comfortable. Lastly, here is a video of my memories in College Matriculation Kedah.
